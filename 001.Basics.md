# **The Basics of Bit Manipulation**

*Meaning of Base* :<br>
- Base is a carry counting system with fixed digital symbols and rules.
- Each carry counting system will have a base. When the base is X, we call it base-X numeral system, which means the number on each digit will be carried over when it reaches X.
- The actual value of a base-X number is determined by each digit and its location. The weight of the *m<sup> th</sup>* digit counting from right to left in the integer part is *X<sup> m</sup>* , and the smallest value of m is 0. 
- The weight of the *n<sup> th</sup>* digit counting from left to right in the fractional part is 
*X<sup> -n</sup>* , and the smallest value of n is 1.

<big>**For example** : </big> 
123.45 in decimal (base-10) can be written as:

- 123.45 = 1 × 10<sup> 2</sup> + 2 × 10<sup> 1</sup> + 3 × 10<sup> 0</sup> + 4 × 10<sup> -1</sup> + 5 × 10<sup> -2</sup>

- 720.5 in octal (base-8) can be written as :
720.5<sub> (8)</sub> = 7 × 8<sup> 2</sup> + 2 × 8<sup> 1</sup> + 0 × 8<sup> 0</sup> + 5 × 8<sup> −1</sup> 

**Commonly used bases**
-
In daily life, the most commonly used base system is the decimal. It has 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

In computer science, the binary system is most commonly used. It has two digits: 0, and 1. Octal (base-8) and hexadecimal (base 16) are also commonly used. Octal has eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

Hexadecimal has sixteen digits: in addition to 0 to 9, there are A, B, C, D, E, and F, corresponding to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 in decimal, respectively.

**Conversion between bases**
-
*Non-decimal to decimal*

To convert a non-decimal number to decimal, we need to add the weighted sum of each digit. For example, to convert the octal number 720.5(8) to decimal.
- 720.5 in octal (base-8) can be written as :
720.5<sub> (8)</sub> = 7 × 8<sup> 2</sup> + 2 × 8<sup> 1</sup> + 0 × 8<sup> 0</sup> + 5 × 8<sup> −1</sup> = 464.625

**Decimal to non-decimal**
-
To convert a decimal number to a base-X non-decimal, we need to convert the integer part and the fractional part, separately.

To convert the integer part, we will integer divide it by X until it reaches 0, and record the remainder each time. Traversing the remainder in reverse order will give us the representation in base-X system.

For example, to convert 50 in base-10 to base-2:

50 / 2 = 25; 50 % 2 = 0

25 / 2 = 12; 25 % 2 = 1

12 / 2 = 6; 12 % 2 = 0

6 / 2 = 3; 6 % 2 = 0

3 / 2 = 1; 3 % 2 = 1

1 / 2 = 0; 1 % 2 = 1

Traversing the remainder in reverse order, we get **1,1,0,0,1,0** , so 50 in decimal will become 
110010<sub>(2)</sub> in binary.

To convert the fractional part, we will multiply the fractional part of the decimal number by **X** until it becomes 0 and record the integer part each time. Traversing the integer part in order will give us the representation in **base-X** system.

For example, to convert the decimal number 0.6875 to binary:

0.6875 × 2 = 1.375 with integer 1

0.375 × 2 = 0.75 with integer 0

0.75 × 2 = 1.5 with integer 1

0.5 × 2 = 1 with integer 1

Traversing the integer apart in order, we get **1,0,1,1** , so 0.6875 in decimal will become 0.1011<sub>(2)</sub> in binary. Note that a finite fraction in one base may become an infinite recurring fraction in another base. For instance, the decimal number 0.2 will become 0.1011<sub>(2)</sub> 

**Conversion between other bases**
-
The common practice to convert between non-base-10 numbers is to convert to decimal first and then convert to the target base. Under certain circumstances, we can perform the conversion without going through decimal.

For instance, for converting binary numbers to octal or hexadecimal, and converting octal or hexadecimal numbers to binary, there is no need to go through the intermediate decimal step. Each digit in an octal number can be represented as three digits in a binary number. Each digit in a hexadecimal number can be represented as four digits in a binary number.

Let’s look at an example. We can group digits in a binary number 
10111001<sub>(2)</sub> in groups of three as **101|110|010**, or in groups of four as **1|0111|0010**, which can be converted to 562<sub>(8)</sub> in octal and 172<sub>(16)</sub> in hexadecimal.
